     From [arxiv API manual](https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual):
     
     The `updated` element provides the last time the contents of the feed were last updated:
     
     Because the arXiv submission process works on a 24 hour submission cycle,
     new articles are only available to the API on the midnight after the articles were processed.
     The `updated` tag thus reflects the midnight of the day that you are calling the API.
     This is very important - search results do not change until new articles are added.
     Therefore there is no need to call the API more than once in a day for the same query.
     Please cache your results. This primarily applies to production systems,
     and of course you are free to play around with the API while you are developing your program!
